            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <strong>Pounded Yam</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the yam tubers and cut them into small, even-sized chunks.</li>
                <li>Rinse the yam chunks thoroughly to remove any dirt or impurities.</li>
                <li>Place the yam chunks in a large pot and add enough water to cover them.</li>
                <li>Place the pot on the stove over medium heat and cook until the yam is soft and tender. This usually takes about 20-30 minutes, depending on the size of the yam chunks.</li>
                <li>Once the yam is cooked, drain the water using a colander or sieve.</li>
                <li>Transfer the drained yam back to the pot and use a yam pounder or a sturdy wooden spoon to pound the yam until it becomes smooth and fluffy. Alternatively, you can use a blender or food processor to blend the yam until smooth.</li>
                <li>Serve the pounded yam hot with the egusi soup.</li>
                </ol>
                
            <strong>Egusi Soup</strong>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat palm oil in a large pot or saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add diced onions and saut√© until they become translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the ground egusi and stir-fry for a few minutes until it starts to release its oil. Be careful not to burn it.</li>
                <li>Add the meat (previously cooked and tenderized) to the pot and stir well to coat it with the egusi.</li>
                <li>If using stockfish and dry fish, add them to the pot at this point.</li>
                <li>Add the ground crayfish, fresh or dried bitter leaves/spinach, and diced fresh peppers to the pot. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Season the mixture with salt, seasoning cubes/powder, and any other preferred spices or herbs.</li>
                <li>Add water or meat stock to achieve the desired consistency of the soup. Stir well and bring it to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot and let the soup cook for about 20-30 minutes, or until the egusi is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.</li>
                <li>If using locust beans and ogiri, add them to the pot and stir gently.</li>
                <li>Adjust the seasoning if needed and add more water if the soup is too thick.</li>
                <li>Finally, add the assorted vegetables (pumpkin leaves, ugu leaves, or bitter leaves) to the pot and cook for an additional 5 minutes until the vegetables are wilted.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and let the egusi soup rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve the egusi soup hot with the pounded yam.</li>
            </ol>
